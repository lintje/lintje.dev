    <h2>Write a story</h2>

    <p>Good commits tell a story. They add context to your Git commits and branches. A commit should explain the problem it solves, the chosen solution and what alternatives were considered.</p>

    <p>Lintje checks a variety of rules, from style to content. Some of these rules are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The subject describes the change in detail. No "Fixed bug" allowed.</li>
      <li>The subject does not start with a prefix: fix, feat, doc, refactor, etc.</li>
      <li>The subject has a maximum of 50 characters.</li>
      <li>The message body contains a reference to a tracking issue.</li>
      <li>Message body lines are a maximum of 72 characters, excluding URLs and code examples.</li>
      <li>A commit contains file changes.</li>
      <li>Fixup and squash commits are rebased before merging.</li>
      <li>Avoid merge commits in feature branches, rebase the branch instead.</li>
      <li>Branch names describe the topic of the changes.</li>
      <li>Branch names don't <em>only</em> include a ticket number.</li>
    </ul>
