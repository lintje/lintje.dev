    <h1>A Git linter for people</h1>

    <p>Improve your team's communication in Git.</p>

    <p>Lintje is an opinionated linter for Git, focussed on promoting communication between people. The idea is to write commits meant for other people reading them during reviews and debug sessions 2+ months from now.</p>

    <h2>Write a book</h2>

    <p>Add context to your Git commits and branches. Write commits that explain the problem the commit solves, what the chosen solution is and what alternatives were considered.</p>

    <p>Lintje helps by checking a variety of rules, from style to content. Some of these rules are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The subject should describe the change. No "fix tests" commits allowed.</li>
      <li>The subject does not start with a prefix: fix, feat, doc, refactor, etc.</li>
      <li>The subject has a maximum of 50 characters.</li>
      <li>The message body contains a reference to the issue it's a part of.</li>
      <li>Message body lines are a maximum of 70 characters, excluding URLs and code examples.</li>
      <li>A commit should contain file changes.</li>
      <li>Fixup and squash commits need to be rebased before merging.</li>
      <li>Avoid merge commits to merge a remote branch into a local feature branch, rebase the branch instead.</li>
      <li>Branch names describe the topic of the changes.</li>
      <li>Branch names don't only include a ticket number.</li>
    </ul>
