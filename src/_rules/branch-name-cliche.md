<%= version_label "0.4.0" %>

The branch name is considered to be a clich√©, it's overused and adds little meaning. This rule scans for branch names that only use two words to describe a change, usually "fix-bug" and "add_test" types of branch names. The words in the example below are the words it scans for.

To resolve this issue, expand the branch name to explain the change in more detail. Describe what type of bug was fixed and what type of change was made.
