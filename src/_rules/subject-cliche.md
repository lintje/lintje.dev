<%= version_label "0.1.0" %>

The commit's subject is considered to be a clich√©, it's overused and adds little meaning. This rule scans for subjects that only use two words to describe a change, usually "fix bug" and "update code" types of subjects. The words in the example below are the words it scans for.

To resolve this issue, expand the subject to explain the change in more detail. Describe what type of bug was fixed and what type of change was made.
