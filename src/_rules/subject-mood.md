<%= version_label "0.1.0" %>

Write commit subjects in the [imperative mood]. The commit is not actively "fixing" an issue, but it is a "fix" for an issue or it does "add" a feature.

Start the subject with something like "Fix ...", but not "Fixes ...", "Fixed ..." or "Fixing ...".

```md
# Good
Fix ...
Test ...
Add ...
Change ...
Update ...
Remove ...

# Bad
Fixes ...
Fixed ...
Fixing ...
Tests ...
Tested ...
Testing ...
Adds ...
Added ...
Adding ...
Changes ...
Changed ...
Changing ...
Updates ...
Updated ...
Updating ...
Removes ...
Removed ...
Removing ...
```

(_Where `...` would describe the change in more detail._)

You are of course free to start the subject with any other words than are listed under the "Good" examples, as long as the subject uses the imperative grammatical mood.
